# Travel Buddy Mobile CRUD Application with Authentication
 N423 Mobile CRUD App - Final Project
 [Firebase Link](https://tripjournal-293122.web.app/)
 
 This application allows users to sign up, login, and logout with an email and password. If they forgot their password, they can retrieve it through email. Once logged in, users can also change their password or delete their account.
 
 The main purpose of the application is to allow users to log trips that they have been on, similar to adding a trip to a physical scrap book or journal. The user would be able to add photos, a trip name, location, date, description, the people who came on the trip with them, and they would be able to rate the trip as well. 
 
 Once a trip is added, it will show up on the home page in a preview list format. The trips on the homepage would only show the featured photo, date, and trip name. The user would be able to filter their trip by most recent, location, or favorited on the home page. The user would then be able to click on each trip and see more details of the trip such as photos, description, people, etc. The detailed trip page would also have options for the user to edit or delete the trip they created.
